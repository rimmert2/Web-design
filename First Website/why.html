            <h2>It's not to late to do something about our oceans!</h2>
            <p>The ocean is vital to the health of our planet and ourselves, and here are some reasons why we need to protect it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Healthy Oceans, Healthy Climate: The ocean plays a major role in regulating the Earth's climate. It absorbs a huge amount of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases, and it generates over half of the oxygen we breathe.</li>
                <li>A Treasure Trove of Life: The ocean is teeming with life, with a vast diversity of species found nowhere else on Earth. Protecting these ecosystems is essential for the health of the planet.</li>
                <li>Food and Resources: The ocean provides a significant portion of the world's food supply, and many medications and other products come from marine organisms.</li>
                <li>Economic Driver: Healthy oceans are crucial for industries like fishing and tourism.</li>
                <li>The Future is Blue: Oceans are still a mystery, with much to be discovered. Protecting them ensures we have a chance to learn more about these hidden depths.</li>  
            </ul>
